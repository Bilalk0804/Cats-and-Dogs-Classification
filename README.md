# Cats-and-Dogs-Classification
This repository contains an implementation of a Cats vs Dogs image classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model aims to classify images of cats and dogs with the goal of achieving high accuracy on the widely known binary image classification task.
# Overview
The Cats vs Dogs classification problem is a common machine learning challenge in computer vision. In this project, we utilize a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm, to separate the two classes of images: cats and dogs.

The goal is to explore the capabilities of SVM in image classification tasks and compare its performance with more complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

# Dataset 
We use the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset, which contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs for training. The dataset is preprocessed into a manageable size for SVM to handle effectively.
